# Virtual_Caliper
Use CV2 to Create a virtual camera-to-measuring device. 

RTMeasure.py and Utils.py work together as a cleaner interface to run the program

Caliper.py is a testing module used to get the software working. Goal is to eliminate this file from the repo once RTMeasure is working fully.
